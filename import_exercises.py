# Exercises
# You will need to use imports to complete each exercise; in addition, these exercise will strengthen your problem solving and python coding skills.

# You will be directed to create specific files in part 1, for the rest you may do your work in either import_exercises.py or import_exercises.ipynb.

# 1. Import and test 3 of the functions from your functions exercise file. Import each function in a different way:

# a. Run an interactive python session and import the module. Call the is_vowel function using the . syntax.

# make sure to change directory to be in python-exercises
# open an iPython session in the terminal, under the python-exercises folder

# IMPORT function_exercises

# function_exercises.is_vowel('a')

# b. Create a file named import_exericses.py. Within this file, use from to import the calculate_tip function directly. 
# Call this function with values you choose and print the result.

FROM function_exercises IMPORT calculate_tip

calculate_tip(100, .3)
